Hi there!

My name is Kenny Larson -- I'm a Public Policy student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor interested in data science and quantiative methods.
I'm currently working as a data fellow at Basecamp Strategy and as the President of Michigan Political Consulting. In my free time, I also
run a youth political journalism website called Poll Position (pollpos.com) which hosts some of my electoral forecasting & polling projects.
This GitHub is where I publish code for both personal and professional projects. 

I'm an eager novice looking to dive into code and am always up for a new challenge/project. If you're interested in working with me, you can contact 
me at chicagokenny@gmail.com. 

Thanks for checking out my code!
